Here only directed graph is formed... because the children is derived from the parent.
this structure can be called a tree also but tree has no cycles so this is a graph.
Tree is also a subset of directed graph.
Cycle detection in directed Graph

A1 ---> B1 ----> A1 

nodes --> cells in our scenario

Algo :

1. initialize dfsVisited and Visited
2. for all nodes from 0 to n run a dfs for the ones where
Visited[node] == false;
3.if Visited[node] == true && dfsVisited[node] == true => CYCLE IS PRESENT
3. else set Visited[node] = true and dfsVisited[node] = true for cur node
4. while backtracking set dfsVisited[node] = false;
5. at the for loops end return with no cycle present; 

Colour Tracking (Cyclic Path) --> Uses Cycle detection Algo
--- >> Delay (For the color to be visible)
--- >> Wait  (Syncronization)


JavaScript Features--->
--- >> setTimeout (delay)
--- >> promises and async await (wait)

to convert asysnc task into sync ---->> wrap set timeout into a promise
